# XTU-DoHET-2024 dataset

- The dataset (XTU-DoHET-2024.zip) is available on the [webside]

- The dataset contains PCAP files of DoH tunnel traffic generated by tuns<sup>[1]</sup>,tcp-over-dns<sup>[2]</sup>,dnstt<sup>[3]</sup>,godoh<sup>[4]</sup> and DNSExfiltrator<sup>[5]</sup>.

- The dataset includes CSV files of statistical traffic features extracted from PCAP files by DoHlyzer<sup>[6]</sup>.

- The captured raw PCAP files are segmented by pcapSpliter<sup>[7]</sup> which using an algorithm consistent with DoHlyzer.

- The destination of all tunnel tools is a suspicious DNS server.

- The dnstt,godoh and DNSExfiltrator directly connects to a DoH server because it supports a DoH protocol.

- On the other hand, the tcp-over-dns and tuns use DoH proxy to convert conventional DNS into DoH.
